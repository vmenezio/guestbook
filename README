-- GUESTBOOK --

At the root folder are located the main files (the ones dealing with the forms sent via Ajax and the display of the page) and the file guestbook.sql, that contains the guestbook database, needed for the proper work of this Guestbook application.

The standard user of this guestbook has username 'Usuario' and password 'senha'. More users can be registered.

Among the other folders, there are /lib, /templates and /tmp, needed for the Smarty templates to work; /bootstrap, needed for the styling of the pages; /classes, that contains the necessary classes for the inner workings of the guestbook and /js, that contains the Ajax scripts that deals with the information received from the forms.
